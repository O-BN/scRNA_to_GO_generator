# scRNA_to_GO_generator

Proposal: 
Automated Gene Ontology Analysis Tool for scRNA Data
Objective
Develop a Python program that automates the extraction of significant genes from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data, analyzes their gene ontology (GO) classifications using the Gene Ontology API, and visualizes the results. This tool is designed for researchers seeking an efficient way to process scRNA results and interpret gene functions.

Features and Workflow
1. Input Processing:
Reads an Excel file containing scRNA results.
Supports dynamic filtering and sorting based on any column title specified by the user. if no column title is specified, it defaults to “cluster”.
Extracts: cluster name, significantly differentiated genes (based on user-defined or default thresholds; (p-value adjust; adj < 0.05), and gene expression level.
2. Gene List Extraction:
For each cluster, store significant differentiation and gene expression values in a dictionary where:
-	The keys are gene names.
-	Values are a list of the gene’s adjusted p-value and the expression level. or other selected parameter values by the user.
Analyzes each dictionary (cluster) separately for its gene ontology.
3. Gene Ontology Analysis:
Uses the Gene Ontology API (https://api.geneontology.org/) to analyze the genes from each dictionary.
-	Retrieves all ontology categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component.
4. Visualization:
Generates a bar chart summarizing the top GO terms for each sample.
Creates a network diagram visualizing relationships between GO terms.
Includes customization options (e.g., number of terms, labels, and colors) with default settings provided.
5. Output:
Gene List Saving:
-	Asks the user whether to save the gene lists.
-	(If yes): Saves all dictionaries in the same Excel file, named “Differentiated_Gene_input_file_name.xlsx”.
-	Each dictionary is stored in two adjacent columns under titles "sample name" and "padj" (or other selected parameter).
Gene Ontology Results**:
-	Displays results and visualizations.
-	Asks the user whether to save the visualizations.
-	(If yes): Saves visualizations as PNG files in the same folder as the input file under the name “GO_results_input_file_name.png".
6. Error Handling:
Skips missing or empty data in the Excel file.
Displays errors encountered during API requests, ensuring users are informed.

Main improvements:
Automation: Reduces manual processing of scRNA results, saving time and effort.
Customization: Users can adjust thresholds and visualization parameters to suit their research needs.
Versatility: Supports comprehensive gene ontology analysis across multiple samples.
Accessibility: Results are easily interpretable through clear graphs and consolidated output files.

Technologies and Libraries:
Excel File Handling: pandas, openpyxl
Gene Ontology API Integration: requests
Visualization: matplotlib, networkx
Data Management: Python standard libraries for file handling and error management.

This project will generate a valuable tool for biological research. In my lab we often spend a lot of time doing it manually. From sorting each sample’s differentiated genes to uploading it to geneontology.org. This program can shorten this prosses significantly. Moreover, the differentiated gene dictionary generated by this program can be used for other purpose.  For instance, another program that can be very useful would be to take the gene names from the directory and with the API of Uniprot.org (https://www.uniprot.org/api-documentation/uniprotkb), sort the gene for the protein location. Out of the results, membranal protein will serve as the basis for search for commercial antibodies in known website that can be change be the user.
To conclude, I know that I will definitely use it.
