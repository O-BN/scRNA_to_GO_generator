### Automated Gene Ontology Analysis Tool for scRNA Data

#### Objective
Develop a Python program that automates the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) clusters for their gene ontology (GO)
extraction of significant genes from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data, analyzes the clusters gene ontology (GO) classifications using the Gene Ontology API, and visualizes the results. This tool is designed for researchers seeking an efficient way to process scRNA results and interpret gene functions.

#### Features and Workflow

##### 1. Input Processing:
- Reads an Excel file containing scRNA results input by the user <input_file_name>.
- Supports dynamic filtering and sorting based on any column title specified by the user. If no column title is specified, it defaults to cluster name="cluster", thresholds="avg_log2FC", gene_name="gene".
- Extracts:
  - Cluster name.
  - Significantly differentiated gene names. based on user-defined or default thresholds (avg_log2FC < 1.5).

##### 2. Gene List Extraction:
- For each cluster, store significant differentiation gane names in a dictionary where:
  - The keys are the clusters.
  - The values are a list of the gane names 
- Analyzes each dictionary (cluster) separately for its gene ontology.

##### 3. Gene Ontology Analysis:
- Uses the Gene Ontology API to analyze the cluster (key) biological process using its gene list (values). default specie="Mus Muscukus".

##### 4. Visualization:
- **Static Visualizations**:
  - Generates a vartical bar chart summarizing the top GO terms for each sample (up to 10). the color of the bar will change according to the significante level of the biological process within the cluster.
  - save the charts as <cluster_name>.png

##### 5. Output:
- **Gene List Saving**:
  - Saves the dictionary in Excel file, named “Differentiated_Gene_<input_file_name>.xlsx”.

- **Gene Ontology Results**:
  - save the results in "Differentiated_Gene_<input_file_name>.xlsx"

<format>”.
- **Summary Report**:
  - Generates a summary report in PDF/HTML format with key findings and visualizations.

##### 6. Performance Optimization:
- Implements multi-threading or asynchronous requests for GO API calls to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Provides an option to cache API responses to avoid repeated queries for the same genes.

##### 7. User Interface:
- Includes a simple GUI using Tkinter for non-programmers. use colorful theme
